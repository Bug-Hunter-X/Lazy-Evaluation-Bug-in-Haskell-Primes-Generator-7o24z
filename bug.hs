This Haskell code suffers from a subtle bug related to lazy evaluation and infinite lists. The function `primes` aims to generate an infinite list of prime numbers.  However, the `filter` operation is not optimized for infinite lists, and can cause unexpected behavior. Specifically, in the call to `take 10 primes`, it attempts to compute the first 10 primes; but because of the lazy nature of the evaluation, the program may never terminate, or consume an excessive amount of resources.

```haskell
primes :: [Integer]
primes = 2 : filter isPrime [3..] 

isPrime :: Integer -> Bool
isPrime n = all (
 k -> n `mod` k /= 0) [2..floor $ sqrt $ fromIntegral n]
```
